The concept just seemed to rigid and like most people, I “failed” after just a few days or weeks. Yet the idea of change stuck in my head. I stumbled upon the idea of having a guiding principle. Nothing so set in stone as “lose 10 pounds” or “go to the gym 3 times a week”, but a thing to keep in mind as the year progresses. Nothing you can fail at.</p>

<p>Then the pandemic hit and the world got turned upside down.</p>

<p>For a few years I gave up on the idea of a theme/principle for the year; I was just trying to survive. At the same time gender hit me upside the head. This isn’t a post about my trans awakening, but being sheltered at home and worried about death made me re-evaluate things and the puzzle finally came together.</p>

<p>I’m reviving the yearly principle for myself. Today I sat down to journal and figure out what 2025 would bring and two words came to me:</p>

<p><strong><em>Push Boundaries</em></strong></p>

<p>So what does that mean to me? There is an unwritten “my” in the middle there (I like to keep the principle/theme pithy). Push the boundaries of my recovery, the boundaries of my anxiety, of my fears.</p>]]></content><author><name>Sky</name><email>mae@wolfsky.pet</email></author><category term="personal" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few years before the pandemic, I stopped making New Year’s resolutions.
